## Statement

---
Let p(x)∈ℚ[x]

Is it true that
A={p(n)+1/n:n∈ℕ}
is strongly complete, in the sense that, for any finite set B
,

{∑n∈Xn:X⊆A∖B finite }

contains all sufficiently large integers?

---

### Comments

Graham [Gr63] proved this is true when p(n)=n
. Erdős and Graham also ask which rational functions r(x)∈ℤ(x)
force {r(n):n∈ℕ}
to be complete?

Graham [Gr64f] gave a complete characterisation of which polynomials r∈ℝ[x]
are such that {r(n):n∈ℕ}
is complete.

In the comments van Doorn has noted that a positive solution for p(n)=n2
follows from [Gr63] together with result of Alekseyev [Al19] mentioned in [283].
