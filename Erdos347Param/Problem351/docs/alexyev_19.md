Let p:ℤ→ℤ
be a polynomial whose leading coefficient is positive and such that there exists no d≥2
with d∣p(n)
for all n≥1

Is it true that, for all sufficiently large m
, there exist integers 

1≤n1<⋯<nk

such that

1=1n1+⋯+1nk
and
m=p(n1)+⋯+p(nk)?

===
Alekseyev [Al19] has proved this when p(x)=x2
, for all m>8542
. For example,
1=12+14+16+112
and
200=22+42+62+122.
